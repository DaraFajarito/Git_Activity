                                            along with a pair of lyrics from its bridge. The interviewer described the

                                            haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget.” Swift announced the song’s
                                            release date
                                            during

                                            revealed that the concept for the music video originated from a lyric in her
                                            1989 song,
                                            “You
